# Getting Started

Install Conda from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Create a new environment from a file:
```bash
conda env create -n <name> --file env.yml
```

You can refer to this [conda cheetsheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/_downloads/843d9e0198f2a193a3484886fa28163c/conda-cheatsheet.pdf). In case the command above fails, we recommend installing the packages one by one in the order specified by [env.yml](env.yml).

This tutorial is only a recommendation. If you want to use other package manager, feel free to do so. The nessecery dependencies are listed in [env.yml](env.yml)
