As the original implementation of MixMatch is written in \texttt{TensorFlow} and does not support the segmentation task, we have re-implemented
and adapted it. To verify the correctness of our implementation, we have run tests on CIFAR10 and compared our results with those reported in \cite{mixmatch-2019} and \cite{wide-resnet-2017}. The 
comparison is shown in table \ref{tab:mixmatch-cifar10}. For details of reported results, see respecitve papers. Our results are based only on one run (due to the time requirements and as our goal
is to only verify our implementation with respect to the original one).
